I made a small Python Script that allows you to access these files uploaded , send requests to a specified URL link and identify the google dorks that work on the URL .


If it's successful , the program returns the URL+Google Dork 

If not , it returns the error ( 404 means it doesn't work / 301 means you have been redirected to another web page ) 


PS : you need to change the files path depending on where you put them in your computer 
I hope this helps you in some ways !
